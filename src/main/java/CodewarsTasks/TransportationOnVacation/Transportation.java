* After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation.
* So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.
* You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation.
* The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers. Every day you rent the car costs $40.
* If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
* Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).
